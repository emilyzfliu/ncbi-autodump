Oncology,Genomically annotated risk model for advanced renal-cell carcinoma: a retrospective cohort study.,,,,,,"The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk model is an established prognostic tool for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma that integrates clinical and laboratory data, but is agnostic to tumour genomics. Several mutations, including BAP1 and PBRM1, have prognostic value in renal-cell carcinoma. Using two independent clinical trial datasets of patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma, we aimed to study whether the addition of the mutation status for several candidate prognostic genes to the MSKCC model could improve the model's prognostic performance.. In this retrospective cohort study, we used available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue and clinical outcome data from patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma assigned to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the COMPARZ trial (training cohort; n=357) and RECORD-3 trial (validation cohort; n=258). Eligible patients in both trials were treatment-naive; had histologically confirmed, advanced, or metastatic renal-cell carcinoma; and a Karnofsky performance status score of at least 70. For each cohort, data from patients in all treatment groups (sunitinib and pazopanib in the training cohort, and everolimus and sunitinib in the validation cohort) were pooled for this analysis. In the training cohort, tumour tissue was used to evaluate somatic mutations by next-generation sequencing, and the association between cancer-specific outcomes (overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response) and the mutation status of six genes of interest (BAP1, PBRM1, TP53, TERT, KDM5C, and SETD2) was tested. Only those genes with prognostic value in this setting were added to the MSKCC risk model to create a genomically annotated version. The validation cohort was used to independently test the prognostic value of the annotated model compared with the original MSKCC risk model.. 357 (32%) of 1110 patients assigned to protocol treatment in the COMPARZ study between August, 2008, and September, 2011, were evaluable for mutation status and clinical outcomes in the training cohort. The independent validation cohort included 258 (55%) of 471 evaluable patients, enrolled between October, 2009, and June, 2011, on the RECORD-3 study. In the training cohort, the presence of any mutation in BAP1 or TP53, or both, and absence of any mutation in PBRM1 were prognostic in terms of overall survival (TP53. The mutation status of BAP1, PBRM1, and TP53 has independent prognostic value in patients with advanced or metastatic renal-cell carcinoma treated with first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Improved stratification of patients across risk groups by use of a genomically annotated model including the mutational status of these three genes warrants further investigation in prospective trials and could be of use as a model to stratify patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma in clinical trials..

Its pathogenesis can follow two different pathways; high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-dependent and HPV-independent. Due to the rarity of VSCC, molecular mechanisms underlying VSCC development remain largely unknown. The study aimed to identify pathogenic mutations implicated in the two pathways of VSCC development.. Using next generation sequencing, 81 VSCC tumors, 52 hrHPV(+) and 29 hrHPV(-), were screened for hotspot mutations in 50 genes covered by the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).. Mutations of TP53 (46% and 41%, of hrHPV(+) and hrHPV(-) cases respectively) and CDKN2A (p16) (25% and 21%, of hrHPV(+) and hrHPV(-) cases respectively) were the most common genetic alterations identified in VSCC tumors. Further mutations were identified in PIK3CA, FBXW7, HRAS, FGFR3, STK11, AKT1, SMAD4, FLT3, JAK3, GNAQ, and PTEN, albeit at low frequencies. Some of the identified mutations may activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The activation of mTOR was confirmed in the vast majority of VSCC samples by immunohistochemical staining.. Detecting pathogenic mutations in 13/50 genes examined at comparable frequencies in hrHPV(+) and hrHPV(-) tumors suggest that genetic mechanisms of the two routes of VSCC pathogenesis may be similar, despite being initiated from different premalignant lesions. Importantly, our data provide a rationale for new anti-VSCC therapies targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway."

However, clinical efficacy of these treatment strategies is limited by low objective response rates and limited progression-free survival due to tumour resistance. Further novel strategies for molecular targeted therapy of NETs of the GEP system are needed. This paper reviews preclinical research models and signalling pathways in NETs of the GEP system. Preclinical and early clinical data on putative novel targets for molecular targeted therapy of NETs of the GEP system are discussed, including PI3K, Akt, mTORC1/mTORC2, GSK3, c-Met, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, embryogenic pathways (Hedgehog, Notch, Wnt/beta-catenin, TGF-beta signalling and SMAD proteins), tumour suppressors and cell cycle regulators (p53, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) CDK4/6, CDK inhibitor p27, retinoblastoma protein (Rb)), heat shock protein HSP90, Aurora kinase, Src kinase family, focal adhesion kinase and epigenetic modulation by histone deacetylase inhibitors."

Activity of these agents may be predicated on selective pressure that modulates RCC biology. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a platform to noninvasively ascertain temporal changes in genomic profile.. To assess the ctDNA profile in a large cohort of mRCC patients, and to assess changes across patients receiving first-line and later lines of therapy.. We obtained the ctDNA profile in mRCC patients who received ctDNA profiling as part of routine clinical care at progression using a 73-gene Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified ctDNA platform.. Genomic alterations (GAs) were pooled for the entire cohort. A comparison of first- and postfirst-line was performed with grouping based on conventional practice patterns (first-line regimens included sunitinib, pazopanib, and bevacizumab, and postfirst-line regimens included everolimus, axitinib, cabozantinib, and nivolumab).. ctDNA clinical results from a nationwide cohort of 220 consecutive patients with mRCC were assessed (145 men, 75 women; median age: 63 yr, interquartile range: 57-70). GAs were detected in 78.6% of patients. The most frequent GAs in the overall cohort included TP53 (35%), VHL (23%), EGFR (17%), NF1 (16%), and ARID1A (12%). Thirty-eight and 64 patients were coded as receiving first-line and later line agents, respectively. The highest disparity in GA frequencies in postfirst-line versus first-line were in TP53 (49% vs 24%), VHL (29% vs 18%), NF1 (20% vs 3%), EGFR (15% vs 8%), and PIK3CA (17% vs 8%) while ARID1A was equivalent (13% vs 11%). Restricting the analysis to later lines versus first-line vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, these differences were even more prominent, particularly for TP53 (64% vs 31%) and NF1 (29% vs 4%).. In the largest assessment of ctDNA-detected GAs prevalence in mRCC to date, the majority of patients demonstrated clinically and biologically relevant GAs. Increasing p53 and mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway (eg, NF1, PIK3CA) alterations in postfirst-line patients with first-line vascular endothelial growth factor-directed therapy may underlie mechanisms of resistance. Routine ctDNA assessment during the clinical course of mRCC patients may have therapeutic implications.. Collection of circulating tumor DNA is feasible in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and analysis of a large cohort demonstrates significant changes in circulating tumor DNA profile across patients' clinical course which may have therapeutic implications."

Accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of these tumors requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of PanNET. It has been shown that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus can improve the progression-free survival of PanNET patients, suggesting that inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway may suppress the progression of PanNET.

TNBC is frequently associated with abnormalities in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway; drugs targeting this pathway are currently being evaluated in these patients. However, the response is variable, partly due to heterogeneity within TNBC, conferring a need to identify biomarkers predicting response and resistance to targeted therapy. In this study, we used a metabolomics approach to assess response to the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in a panel of TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) (n = 103 animals). Tumor metabolic profiles were acquired using high-resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Partial least-squares-discriminant analysis on relative metabolite concentrations discriminated treated xenografts from untreated controls with an accuracy of 67% (p = 0.003). Multilevel linear mixed-effects models (LMM) indicated reduced glycolytic lactate production and glutaminolysis after treatment, consistent with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition. Although inherent metabolic heterogeneity between different PDX models seemed to hinder prediction of treatment response, the metabolic effects following treatment were more pronounced in responding xenografts compared to nonresponders. Additionally, the metabolic information predicted p53 mutation status, which may provide complementary insight into the interplay between PI3K signaling and other drivers of disease progression."

A novel target for inhibiting p53 degradation and for causing reexpression of p53wild type is inhibition of MDM2. The small molecule NVP-CGM097 is a novel MDM2 inhibitor. We investigated MDM2 inhibition as a target in neuroendocrine tumor cells in vitro.. Human neuroendocrine tumor cell lines from the pancreas (BON1), lung (NCI-H727), and midgut (GOT1) were incubated with the MDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097 (Novartis) at concentrations from 4 to 2,500 nM.. While p53wild type GOT1 cells were sensitive to NVP-CGM097, p53mutated BON1 and p53mutated NCI-H727 cells were resistant to NVP-CGM097. Incubation of GOT1 cells with NVP-CGM097 at 100, 500, and 2,500 nM for 96 h caused a significant decline in cell viability to 84.9 ± 9.2% (p < 0.05), 77.4 ± 6.6% (p < 0.01), and 47.7 ± 9.2% (p < 0.01). In a Western blot analysis of GOT1 cells, NVP-CGM097 caused a dose-dependent increase in the expression of p53 and p21 tumor suppressor proteins and a decrease in phospho-Rb and E2F1. Experiments of co-incubation of NVP-CGM097 with 5-fluorouracil, temozolomide, or everolimus each showed additive antiproliferative effects in GOT1 cells. NVP-CGM097 and 5-fluorouracil increased p53 and p21 expression in an additive manner.. MDM2 inhibition seems a promising novel therapeutic target in neuroendocrine tumors harboring p53wild type. Further investigations should examine the potential role of MDM2 inhibitors in neuroendocrine tumor treatment."

Many UM patients develop metastases for which no curative treatment has been identified. Novel therapeutic approaches are therefore urgently needed. UM is characterized by mutations in the genes GNAQ and GNA11 which activate the PKC pathway, leading to the use of PKC inhibitors as a rational strategy to treat UM tumors. Encouraging clinical activity has been noted in UM patients treated with PKC inhibitors. However, it is likely that curative treatment regimens will require a combination of targeted therapeutic agents. Employing a large panel of UM patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs), several PKC inhibitor-based combinations were tested in vivo using the PKC inhibitor AEB071. The most promising approaches were further investigated in vitro using our unique panel of UM cell lines. When combined with AEB071, the two agents CGM097 (p53-MDM2 inhibitor) and RAD001 (mTORC1 inhibitor) demonstrated greater activity than single agents, with tumor regression observed in several UM PDXs. Follow-up studies in UM cell lines on these two drug associations confirmed their combination activity and ability to induce cell death. While no effective treatment currently exists for metastatic uveal melanoma, we have discovered using our unique panel of preclinical models that combinations between PKC/mTOR inhibitors and PKC/p53-MDM2 inhibitors are two novel and very effective therapeutic approaches for this disease. Together, our study reveals that combining PKC and p53-MDM2 or mTORC1 inhibitors may provide significant clinical benefit for UM patients. "

Here, we report that gain-of-function mutant p53 proteins inhibit the autophagic pathway favoring antiapoptotic effects as well as proliferation of pancreas and breast cancer cells. We found that mutant p53 significantly counteracts the formation of autophagic vesicles and their fusion with lysosomes throughout the repression of some key autophagy-related proteins and enzymes as BECN1 (and P-BECN1), DRAM1, ATG12, SESN1/2 and P-AMPK with the concomitant stimulation of mTOR signaling. As a paradigm of this mechanism, we show that atg12 gene repression was mediated by the recruitment of the p50 NF-κB/mutant p53 protein complex onto the atg12 promoter. Either mutant p53 or p50 NF-κB depletion downregulates atg12 gene expression. We further correlated the low expression levels of autophagic genes (atg12, becn1, sesn1, and dram1) with a reduced relapse free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) of breast cancer patients carrying TP53 gene mutations conferring a prognostic value to this mutant p53-and autophagy-related signature. Interestingly, the mutant p53-driven mTOR stimulation sensitized cancer cells to the treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. All these results reveal a novel mechanism through which mutant p53 proteins promote cancer cell proliferation with the concomitant inhibition of autophagy."

Characteristics of the original tumors were well retained in cancer tissue-originated spheroids including morphology and expression of p53 or neuroendocrine markers. We screened 79 molecular targeting drugs using two cancer tissue-originated spheroid lines derived from endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade 3 and serous adenocarcinoma. Among several hits, we focused on everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor, and YM155, a survivin inhibitor. When sensitivity to everolimus or YM155 was assessed in 12 or 11 cancer tissue-originated spheroids, respectively, from different endometrial cancer patients, the sensitivity varied substantially. The cancer tissue-originated spheroids sensitive to everolimus showed remarkable suppression of proliferation. The phosphorylation status of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 downstream molecules before and after everolimus treatment did not predict the effect of the drug.

Currently, there are no direct anti-KRAS therapies available. Therefore, it is rational to target the downstream molecules of KRAS signaling pathway, which are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (RAF-MEK-ERK) and PI3K pathway (PI3K-AKT-mTOR). Here, we examined the inhibition of both these pathways alone and in combination and analyzed the anti-proliferative and apoptotic events in KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines, A549 and Calu-1. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay after the cells were treated with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), U0126 (MEK inhibitor), and RAD001 (mTOR inhibitor) for 24 and 48 h.

We wondered whether LKB1 loss could be deregulated at the transcriptional level to promote tumor progression and poor outcome in colorectal cancer.","Mechanistic studies were performed in two each of p53 wild-type (HCT116, LoVo) and p53-mutated (SW480, HT29) colon cancer cells to explore whether LKB1 loss could be deregulated by NKX2-1-mediated p53 pathway. LKB1 and NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1) expressions in colorectal tumors were determined by immunohistochemistry, and the prognostic value of both molecules was assessed by Kaplan-Meier test and Cox regression model.","Mechanistically, LKB1 loss at the transcriptional level due to alteration of the NKX2-1-mediated p53 pathway promotes invasiveness in colon cancer cells. The cell invasiveness induced by LKB1 loss was nearly suppressed by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (rapamycin and everolimus) and mTOR/AKT dual inhibitor Palomid 529 (P529). Among patients, low LKB1 tumors exhibited shorter overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival periods than high LKB1 tumors. The highest hazard ratio value for OS and relapse-free survival was observed in wild-type p53 with low LKB1/low NKX2-1 tumors and in mutated p53 with low LKB1/high NKX2-1 tumors when wild-type p53 with high LKB1/high NKX2-1 and mutated p53 with high LKB1/low NKX2-1 tumors were used as references.","LKB1 loss at the transcriptional level via alteration of the NKX2-1/p53 axis promotes cell invasion, consequently resulting in poor outcome in colorectal cancer patients.",

We previously demonstrated co-activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MET, and AXL in mesothelioma cell lines, suggesting that these kinases could serve as novel therapeutic targets. Although clinical trials have not shown activity for EGFR inhibitors in mesothelioma, concurrent inhibition of various activated RTKs has pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in mesothelioma cell lines. Thus, we hypothesised that a coordinated network of multi-RTK activation contributes to mesothelioma tumorigenesis.","Activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Raf/MAPK, and co-activation of RTKs were evaluated in mesotheliomas. Effects of RTK and downstream inhibitors/shRNAs were assessed by measuring mesothelioma cell viability/growth, apoptosis, activation of signalling intermediates, expression of cell-cycle checkpoints, and cell-cycle alterations.","We demonstrate activation of the PI3K/AKT/p70S6K and RAF/MEK/MAPK pathways in mesothelioma, but not in non-neoplastic mesothelial cells. The AKT activation, but not MAPK activation, was dependent on coordinated activation of RTKs EGFR, MET, and AXL. In addition, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition recapitulated the anti-proliferative effects of concurrent inhibition of EGFR, MET, and AXL. Dual targeting of PI3K/mTOR by BEZ235 or a combination of RAD001 and AKT knockdown had a greater effect on mesothelioma proliferation and viability than inhibition of individual activated RTKs or downstream signalling intermediates. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT was also associated with MDM2-p53 cell-cycle regulation.","These findings show that PI3K/AKT/mTOR is a crucial survival pathway downstream of multiple activated RTKs in mesothelioma, underscoring that PI3K/mTOR is a compelling target for therapeutic intervention.",
